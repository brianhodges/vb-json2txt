Just a reference for myself to refer back to when working on future Visual Basic projects. Reads in local JSON file and outputs data in formatted TXT file.

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/vb-json2txt
  cd vb-json2txt
  ```
*Build/Run Project and a formatted log.txt file will output to the project /bin*
